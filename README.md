# QMake-PCL-VTK
I hate CMake.  I mean, I hate it. And I've always felt that the 'C' stood for cancer because any library built with CMake instantly requires any project to also use CMake.  A perfect example is VTK, and if you are reading this now, you also hate CMake.  Does it surprise you that both CMake and VTK come from KitWare?  And when you ask the question, how do I link against VTK using QMake, people respond, "you should use CMake."  But I then say, "but I don't want to use CMake." To which CMake fans say, "I know how you feel.  You should use CMake."  And around and around it goes.

So finally, I've reached my breaking point.  I'm throwing down the gauntlet.  I'm going to use PCL and VTK libraries without CMake, and no one can stop me.  So here is a simple project for demonstrating the combination of PCL and VTK in a QMake project.  I hope you enjoy it!
